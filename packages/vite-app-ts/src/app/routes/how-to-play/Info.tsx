      This is a game of sports trading cards run on the ethereum block chain. Buy a surfer and the proceeds will
      transferred into a pot of money. You win prize money if your surfer is the overall champion at the end of the
      season (~50% of the total pot) OR if your surfer places 1st, 2nd or 3rd in one of the 10 competitions. If someone
      already owns a surfer you can make them an offer and if they accept you will receive the prize money earned by
      that surfer.
